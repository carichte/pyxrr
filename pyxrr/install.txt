(This is short. For further information see http://docs.python.org/install/)

Start a python command line and change to this directory.

Then:


Compile:
    python setup.py build -f


    Then if no errors but only warnings have occured copy into packages folder:
        python setup.py install   #for all users

    OR only for the current user
        python setup.py install --user




OR into local folder only:
    python setup.py build_ext -f -i


the same applies to setup_singlecore.py


especially for WINDOWS one may have to specify the compiler (e.g. mingw):
    python setup.py build -c mingw32
